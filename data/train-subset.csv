I found time to write a bit so here it goes! Remember BIL is dating now SIL and he's now thinking of marrying her. We were sitting in the room at the il's house just us three. BIL is talking to DH about it. SIL has a dog that she's had for years. It was a gift to her by her father when he became very ill, near death. The reality hit him that life is short and he decided to start making good on some of his promises before he died. He always told SIL he would get her a dog, they were a military family, and he'd always say the next place we move I'll get it for you. So he got her this dog at that time and she loves her dog and he has sentimental value to her. Now, BIL has not yet met this dog because you know it's serious when you meet the dog. BIL sates to DH: Well the dog has to go. I have allergies and I can't be living with a dog. I know the dog has sentimental meaning for her because of her dad but my health is more important than a dog. She's waiting for me to meet the dog because she wants him to slowly warm up to me. This is stupid, it's just a dog... I don't see what the big deal is. I want to marry her but if we get married we'll already have to get an apartment and that costs money there (both of them at the time were living with their parents and would meet each other for dates and such). If we keep the dog then we have to pay extra money for pet rent and I'm not paying extra money for a dog!!! DH is just nodding his head and listening (he's pretty laid back and quiet always like this guess it's true opposites attract). I'm thinking how rude is this guy? He wants to marry her and is supposed to love her but can't have compassion for what she loves??? I know he's SNOT JR. For sure. Anyway he meets the dog and they get engaged. They have all these big events that I find my way out of because I can't stand being around them. They had a family celebration right after he proposed and a joint couple shower. SNW knows how creative and crafty I am, especially after my wonderful diy wedding decor, so she asks me to help her decorate for the rehearsal dinner. I reluctantly agree to help her. DH and I have been married over 3 years at this point. SNW has never made any efforts to call, text, smoke signal, or communicate with me in any way or form any relationship with me. Can't remember if I posted about this before but I did invite her to an event to be the bigger person, but she basically fought me even giving it to her. The event was based on a book and I wanted to buy her the book and put the tickets inside as a Christmas gift. She was like oh I don't want a book. And then proceeded to text DH about how she doesn't want whatever I'm trying to get her, that he knows the type of gifts she likes and to stick to that. I was so angry... I was raised knowing when people get you a gift you accept because the person thought about you and took their time to get it for you so be grateful! Guess not everyone learned that. I still invite her after my moms advise but said well I was trying to do this for you but since you didn't want it I'm asking you now would you like to go with me. Then she's like oh I would love to go I had no idea thats what it was, super nice in front of everyone. We went to the event and she straight up did not talk to me the whole time and went off in her own during the intermissions. Sorry for going off topic but you get the point. Now all of a sudden she's blowing me up about this wedding rehearsal. She texts several times a day and calls about her ideas and sends me pics. She's always like Hi how are you then goes for what she wants... I'm not fooled at all, she never cared how I was doing for over three years. She says Oh well SIL and I have been talking about the plans and blah blah blah. Basically trying to run in my face that she talks to SIL all the time and she's being involved in the planning. unlike with my wedding, but that's because she got mad at me for not doing what she wanted and did CBF the rest of the time I was planning. I tell DH about this sudden change of behavior and how much involved SNW is in this wedding as compared to ours. He suggests well maybe because she has a good relationship with SIL she realizes she needs to do better with you and this is her way of reaching out to you... I say maybe but I know its all fake..."

Is there any way I can quickly cure them for aquarium use? My understanding is that you don't want to put green branches into an aquarium. I've got a couple small tanks (5.5g, 2.5g) that I'd like to put these in, but only if I don't have to leave them outside for year(s) first. The branches are small, the biggest one has a maximum diameter of 0.75 inches, but they're mostly closer to 0.25-0.5 inches. The outer black bark is gone, but the inner red bark is still on them. Here's my questions: 1) Is there any way I can quickly dry them out in an oven or something? Would they be safe to boil and use at that point? 2) Usually the things I've read say that the bark needs to be removed or it'll slowly peel off. As long as it were to not peel off in tiny pieces, and as long as it were safe, I wouldn't mind that. I don't have a sandblaster to remove bark with either. Is it out of the question to leave the bark on? (ie is it super obnoxious or toxic?) Thanks guys!"

Even though some may think that what you do is abnormal or unusual, what matters the most is that you have confidence in yourself and in what you are doing.

And it doesn't mean there are no talented women (really?); just that by-and-large women and men tend to have slightly different talents and inclinations. What we need is equality of opportunity, and a willingness not to stereotype on the basis of aggregate behaviours, rather than equality of outcome.

I've often created fun and interesting decks for non-competitive play. I like to try strange decks just to see if I can get them to work. I think it's fun and it's one of the ways I have found to alleviate frustration when grinding ladder. A problem, though, is that I'll make a funky pirate shaman deck or a rogue deck with only two minions, etc. and want to just dick around and have fun with it. I'll go into casual and lose to aggro shaman or control Mage enough times that I feel like I should be playing a ranked deck to have a little more fun, and I'm back to grinding ladder. This brings me to my point. You can choose the class you play against in practice mode, letting you see how your deck fares in certain match ups. I think it would be fun and innovating to be able to choose a deck for the innkeeper to play against you. This could have practical benefits (like a mirror match to test out changes in a ranked deck) or it could be really fun (giving the innkeeper a golden Milhouse Manastorm). It could even be used to mess with deck interplay (thief rogue against a stacked deck). What do you guys think?"

I was working in a sunglass and lifestyle store when I got bored and decided to cover myself from head to toe in snowboarding gear. All the way from pants and jacket to gloves, facemask, goggles and hat. Not a single piece of skin was showing. I goofed off in the store for a bit and then decided to go stand in the big glass front window. This is where the FU happens. I am standing in there as still as can be and getting a couple of weird looks but nothing too strange. For the most part people aren't noticing me. Then a little kid (maybe 12 years old) comes right up to the glass and stares at me, obviously noticing something isn't right. That's when the practical joker in me takes over and I throw my hands up and scare the crap out of the little bugger. He runs off half scared half laughing and I leave the window display and get back to actually working. A few minutes later an older fellow comes in and says he saw what I did and that it was incredibly racist...ohh, I didn't mention that the little kid was black, because to a normal person they wouldn't even think in those terms. The older fellow was black too. He goes on to tell me that he's a professor at one of the Ivy League colleges across town and that he studies this kind of stuff regularly and that what I did was incredibly racist. He lectured me a bit more, and I just stood there and listened since I was so caught off guard then he finished by saying that it was because of people like me doing that kind of stuff that black people were afraid of white people. TLDR: pretended to be a mannequin. Scared a little kid who happened to be black. Got called a racist."

His dad is apparently a very high-ranking official in the UN. And due to an unfortunate strings of circumstances, Kevin sat next to me: * Kevin had zero computer skills. As a new employee, the company will issue you the standard computer, 8GB flash drive, along with employee handbook, etc. etc. He refused the flash drive because the size was too small (physically) and he believed it won't have any storage capacity. * So he kept having to borrow my flash drive. He also didn't know how to plug it into his computer and kept complaining that the flash drive is ""broken"". * We're an international company with offices in many countries. So, it goes without saying that we all communicate through email. He drafts EVERY EMAIL (even simple replies) on PAPER and then asks me to proof read it before he sends it out. He works as a COPYWRITER. * He asked me if the ""SEND"" button in Outlook means that his email was sent out. * He has more than once got scammed by those Nigerian Prince emails. He sends them his password when they ask for it. * He likes to google my full name (it's not a common name at all. Only I have it.). He googles it often enough that it pops up every time he types in the first letter of my name on Google. One day, he got so excited and showed it to me because I was ""FAMOUS"" because Google knows my name. * Each month, the housekeeper would walk around and issue out tissue paper to put at our workstation. The first time, he asked me what it was. * He drives the cleaning ladies insane by going into the pantry, use plates and mugs and put them back in the cupboard without washing them. When confronted, his argument was that he'll use it again eventually. * He likes to listen in on conversations. More than once, he would ask me what people in five workstations away were talking about. * He stares at people. ALL. THE. TIME. And stare at your computer screen and comment on what you're working on. * He didn't know how to put staples in staplers. When I helped him with it, his reply: ""Thank you so much. I'm just not used to these new technologies."" * He constantly asks people how much their salary is. * His probation period was extended (understandably. he was still asking me to proofread his emails). When HR told him, he threw a tantrum claiming that they can't do that because he already told his mom that he passed the probation. * He often takes his copywriting work home for his mom to check. This is what I can think of from the top of my head. I'm know there's more as he drove me nuts to the point that I wanted to quit and the Head of HR had to console me. I was his designated babysitter for the duration of his time there. People still joke that one day he might come into the office and shoot everyone. I would be the first to go."

As frustrating as it is with conspiracy theorists (I mean I use that term even loosely because, as you mentioned, the extent of research these people do is a bunch of YouTube videos and Anonymous's Facebook feed nonsense) calling everyone who doesn't believe this trash ""sheeple"" and demanding that we ""wake up!"" and ""do research"" is equally as annoying as people who sit on the other side and attack them, saying that they're wearing ""tin foil hats"", that they are ""crazy"" and ""uninformed"". Honestly just let people form their own ideas even if they seem ridiculous. Their crazy ideas aren't hurting you. It seems that with social media everybody is quick to calling each other a *somethingist* and tell others how wrong they are. So what if they're wrong? and so what if someone doesn't believe what you do? It's exhausting, tiresome and pointless to try and convince a stranger on the internet to switch to your side, and it never happens. Basically I just hate both types of people with regards to this."

I've always personally been a fan of armor acting as a damage subtraction modifier instead (essentially making high armor targets impervious to high rate of fire low damage weapons), since it at least is different, whereas the current system could be entirely eliminated in favor of just more base health. Then you can have armor *penetration*, which reduces how effective armor is at subtracting your damage, and a flat health type modifier which multiplies your damage according to its type. If you want a more involved system, just make armor its own health bar like shields, and make certain damage types reduce it over time. Damage type modifiers would affect armor health and enemy health separately, so you don't deal +1000% damage because the enemy has 1 armor point left."
